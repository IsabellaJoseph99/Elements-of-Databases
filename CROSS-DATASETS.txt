Think of 3 interesting queries that span your primary and secondary datasets

QUERY 1:
For our first query, we expect to compare Education vs Income in the states of Texas and Massachusetts.
We will do this by using EDUCA and INCOME2 from the DEMOGRAPHICs table. 
We will join the demographic tabes of both Texas and Massachusetts based on equal EDUCA values, and find the average income for each in each state. 
This will be done using an INNER JOIN. 
To calculate the average, we will use the aggregate function AVERAGE().

QUERY 2:
We would like to compare the general, mental and physical health in in the states of Texas and Massachusetts based on SEX. 
We will do this by using GENHLTH, PHYSHLTH and MENTHLTH from the OVERALL_Health_Status table and the SEX from the demographics table.
We will join the Texas and Massachusetts tables on equal SEX values, and calculate an average valye for GENHLTH, PHYSHLTH and MENTHLTH.
This will be done using an INNER JOIN. 
To calculate the average, we will use the aggregate function AVERAGE().

QUERY 3:
Lastly, we want to see if there is any relationship between smoking and income in each state. 
We will use the SMOKE100 values from the TOBACCO_USE tables, and the INCOME2 values from the DEMOGRAPHIC tables.
We will join both tables on equaly INCOME2 brackets, and see how SMOKE100 values vary.
This will be done using an INNER JOIN. 

TRANSFORMATIONS:
The data set needs to be cleaned. We need to remove duplicates from SEQNO which is the PK of our tables. 
We then need to run the exact transformations we ran on the first dataset which are:
 - WEIGHT2 gave respondants both metric and imperial options for submitting their weight, so we need to convert kilograms to pounds. 
 - HEIGHT3 included both metric and imperial options for submitting height, so we need to convert meters into inches.
